# üóíÔ∏è Ethical Hacking Cheatsheets

In this documenht I will post my **Ethical** Hacking cheatsheets. It covers the different areas of **Ethical** Hacking, including password cracking, obfuscation and exploit development (BOFs for noobies like me).

‚ö†Ô∏è The document is not finished, I have to add a lot more of content and sort everything in a better way. Also, the CyberSecurity area is always evolving, which means that is always generating new knowledge, for this reason this document will never be finished. ‚ö†Ô∏è

This document is **NOT** for malicious porpouses.

## üîç [Information Gathering](info_gathering.md)
In this section you will find different OSINT tools. This tools are divided in two groups:
- **Passive Information Gathering**: The tools presented in this section collect information without establishing direct communication between yourself and the target
- **Active Information Gathering**: This tools establish communication between you and the target (p.e. querying their DNS) to collect as much information as they can.

## üì° [Scanning & Enumeration](scan_enum.md)
Here we have different tools and methods that will help us to enumerate the network (*nmap*) or a specific service such as FTP.

## üíª [Webapp Methology](web_Methology.md)
A short list of which steps to follow when performing a pentest on a webapp.

## üö© [Post Exploitation](post.md)
After we have enumerate, exploit a service and gain control of the target machine, we will need two priordial things:
- Upload/Download files to/from the target machine.
- Detect possible privilege escalation vectors such as *Juicy Potato* in Windows or a vulnerable *cron job* in Linux.

## ‚¨õ [AV Evasion]
Different AV evasion techniques explained.

## üêö [Shells & Reverse Shells](shells.md)
Here you will find a list of useful reverse shells done with different coding languages. The big part of them are made as *one line*.
Also is explained how to upgrade a shell in Linux (where we will find with this problem a hundreds times).

## ü™≤ [Exploit Development](exploit_dev.md)
Very noobie introduction to Windows and Linux Buffer Overflow.

## #Ô∏è‚É£ [Password Cracking](passwd_crack.md)
Password cracking tools. 
## [Wireless Penetration Testing](wireless.md)
(*‚ö†Ô∏è Under construction*)

## [Miscellaneous](misc.md)
